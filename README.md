# Welcome

Hi! I'm **Mukhil C**, and I work on hierarchical triple systems, Kozai–Lidov oscillations, and gravitational-wave astrophysics.  
This website hosts my  **research summaries**, **Master's thesis**, **posters**, and **CV**.

# Research

My research focuses on:

- Hierarchical triple systems (HTSs)
- Secular dynamics
- Kozai–Lidov oscillations
- Gravitational wave emission from eccentric binaries
- Detectability of these sources with LISA and ground-based detectors

More detailed summaries and preprints will be added here soon.
