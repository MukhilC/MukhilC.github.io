I've done my Bachelor's in Science (Physics, Electronics, Mathematics) at St. Joseph's College, Bengaluru and my Master's in Physics at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). Currently, I'm working as an research intern at CHRIST University. 

# Research

My current research mainly pertains to the dynamics and stability of hierarchical triple systems, especially concerning the Kozai-Lidov mechanism and it's effect on the orbital dynamics. I am also working on simulating the gravitational waveforms produced by these systems. I have submitted a paper on the same, titled "Dynamics of Hierarchical Triple Systems and their Gravitational Wave Detectability", which is currently under review. Check out this [poster](./poster.md)  for more information on the project. This paper is based on my Master's Thesis, titled "Towards Gravitational Wave Templates for Hierarchical Triple Systems: A Preliminary Study" and can be found [here](./thesis.md)

On the side, as a personal project, I am also working on photon rings created by various black hole solutions and black hole mimickers as well. Using GYOTO for this purpose.
