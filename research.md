# Research

My research focuses on:

- Hierarchical triple systems (HTSs)
- Secular dynamics
- Kozai–Lidov oscillations
- Gravitational wave emission from eccentric binaries
- Detectability of these sources with LISA and ground-based detectors

More detailed summaries and preprints will be added here soon.
